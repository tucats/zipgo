# zipgo

Command line tool to zip-encode a file or directory and write a Go file that can unpack the embedded zip file.

```text
Usage: zipgo [options] <path>

Options:
  -d, --data            Write only the zip data constant to the source file.
  -h, --help            Print this help text and exit
  -l, --log             Log the files as they are added to the zip archive.
  -x, --omit <files>    Comma-separated list of files names to omit from the zip archive.
  -o, --output <file>   Write output to <file> (default: unzip.go)
  -p, --package <name>  Specify Go package name (default: main)
  -v, --version         Print version and exit
```

The `zipgo` command will read a single file or a directory tree (identified as the _path_ in the
command line invocation). The file is compressed using the standard `zip` algorithm, and then
expressed as a base64 character string constant. This constant is written to a Go source file,
and is suitable to be included in a Go workspace that wishes to unzip the static archive of the
file or directory at runtime.

## Options

The command line options may be expressed in any order. Any command line item that is not
recognized as a command line option is assumed to be the path to the file or directory to
be archived.

### --data

When `--data` is added to the command line, the output source file generated by `zipgo` contains
only the Go `const` string that holds the archive. It does not contain the function that will
extract the archive back to disk. This is useful if you separate the unzip function into its
own source file. Then, when you need to regenerate the archive data, you need only generate the
source file with the archive constant.

If `--data` is not on the command line, then the resulting source file contains a function
named Unzip in addition to the archive data. This function can be called by the Go program
and is passed a location path in which to extract the archive. See the section later on
using the resulting source program.

### --help

Using the `--help` option displays a text message similar to the one at the top of this
document on the user's console, describing the command line usage and the command line
options.

The `zipgo` command then exits without doing any further work.

### --log

The `--log` command line option causes the command to print a message to the stdout
listing each directory and file that is recursively processed to create the archive.
By default, no log messages are generated.

### --omit

The `--omit` option specifies one or more files that are to be omitted from the archive
as it is created. You can specify this option as many times as you wish on the command
line, or you can express the list as a comma-separated string enclosed in quotes.  The
list should not include directory path information, only the filename.  For example,

```zsh
zipgo lib --omit "server.key,server.crt"
```

This generates an archive for the directory ./lib but omits any files named "server.key"
or "server.crt" found anywhere in the tree. All other files not specified in the omit
list will be included in the archive.

### --output

The `--output` option specifies the name of the output file. If the option is not given,
the output is assumed to be "unzip.go" in the current directory. This file contains the
Go source for the string constant containing the entire generated archive, as well as
the Unzip function that can extract the archive back to disk.  See the `--data` option
above for information on how to omit the Unzip function from the output source if
desired.

### --package

The `--package` option specifies the name of the Go package the output source file
is a member of. If not specified, the default is "main". If you wish the resulting
Go source file to be in a subdirectory of your workspace with a different package
name, use this option to specify that name.

### --version

This causes the `zipgo` command to display it's version number, and then exit.

## Using zipgo

This tool is used by the Ego package to generate a skeleton ./lib directory when
the Ego program determines that no library exists already. In this case, the Ego
program extracts the stored archive and writes it to the library location.

To generate the archive, the `zipgo` command is invoked, which looks something
like this:

```zsh
zipgo  -l -p app -o app-cli/app/unzip.go ./lib -x "https-server.key,https-server.crt"
```

This generates a file called "unzip.go" in the `app` package within the Ego source
tree. This archive will contain all the files in the ./lib directory tree, _except_
the files "https-server.key" and "https-server.crt" if those files are found. It is
not an error to omit files that do not exist.

The purpose of this is to allow the development build to generate the archive file
but omit server-specific secrets that are stored in the lib directory.
